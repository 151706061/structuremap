StructureMap is a [Dependency
Injection](http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html) / [Inversion of
Control](InversionOfControl.htm) tool for .Net that can be used to improve
the architectural qualities of an object oriented system by reducing the
mechanical costs of good design techniques. StructureMap can enable looser
coupling between classes and their dependencies, improve the testability of a
class structure, and provide generic flexibility mechanisms. Used judiciously,
StructureMap can greatly enhance the opportunities for code reuse by minimizing
direct coupling between classes and configuration mechanisms.


StructureMap is released under the permissive Apache 2 OSS license.  You are
free to download, modify, or redistribute StructureMap in any way you see fit 
**without restriction**.


Consider using StructureMap if you:


* Require significant extensibility
*  Simply want a generic configuration tool
*  Want to support multiple deployment configurations
* Are using a Test-Driven Development philosophy or want to largely automate testing
* Want to isolate a troublesome subsystem or provide smooth migration paths away from legacy interfaces
* Need a great deal of configurable properties or plugin hot spots 

Do not use StructureMap if an application or process requires little
flexibility. The abstraction and indirection afforded by StructureMap is
unnecessary and even harmful in simpler systems or processes. 


The easiest way to get started is with the [StructureMap
QuickStart](QuickStart.htm).  Please send any questions or suggestions to
the [ StructureMap User
Group](http://groups.google.com/group/structuremap-users/post?hl=en) on Google
Groups.

Status
---------------------------------

StructureMap is the oldest IoC/DI tool for .Net development and has been used in
multiple production systems since June 2004.  The current version 2.5.2 was
released in January 2009, with a 2.6 release scheduled for no later than the end
of January 2009.  StructureMap is primarily maintained and developed by [Jeremy
D. Miller](mailto:jeremydmiller@yahoo.com?subject=StructureMap),[The Shade Tree
Developer](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller) and [Joshua
Flanagan](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/joshuaflanagan/default.aspx) with
other contributions from the community.
